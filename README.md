# Hotel-Management-System

The project which we are going to build is Hotel Management System. Most of the hotels don’t have an effective management system and many of them still use the traditional ways of writing the details on registers. They don’t offer smart ways for reservation of clients nor they offer any proper way of attendance for the employees. For, our project we are proposing of making a smart management system for the hotels, which provides the clients a better way of reservation, administration will be able to manage the salaries of the employees, customer’s information will be saved for further reservations. This will reduce the paper work, will save time and will give the hotel officials to manage the system in all possible aspects.
